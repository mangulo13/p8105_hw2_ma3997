## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
        read_xlsx("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                  range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
        janitor::clean_names() %>% 
        drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
        mutate(
                sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
                sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)) %>% 
        view
median(pull(trashwheel_df, sports_balls))
```

    ## [1] 8

Read precipitation data

``` r
precip_2018 = 
        read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
                   sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
                   skip = 1) %>% 
        janitor::clean_names() %>% 
        drop_na(month) %>% 
        mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
        relocate(year) %>% 
        view


precip_2017 = 
        read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
                   sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
                   skip = 1) %>% 
        janitor::clean_names() %>% 
        drop_na(month) %>% 
        mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
        relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation.

``` r
month_df = 
        tibble(
                month = 1:12,
                month_name = month.name
        )

precip_df = 
        bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017) 

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month") %>% 
        view
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, MD. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data.

The total precipitation for 2018 was 70.33 inches.

The median number of sports balls in 2018 was 8.

## Problem 2

Read the NYC Transit data

``` r
transit_df = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
        janitor::clean_names() %>%
        select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>%
        mutate(entry = recode(entry,YES = TRUE, NO = FALSE))%>% 
        view
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset contains information on the subway lines in New York City
including station names, location, entrances, routes, and ADA
compliance. There are 1868 rows and 19 columns in this dataset. The data
was tidied by cleaning column names, selecting columns of interest, and
reformatting “entry” as a logical variable instead of character.

This dataset is not super tidy. Routes are untidy with observations and
variables as longer than wider.

Let’s look at the number of unique stations, those that are ADA
compliant, and those without vending that allow entry.

``` r
distinct(transit_df, line, station_name) %>% 
        count()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##       n
    ##   <int>
    ## 1   465

``` r
filter(transit_df, ada == TRUE) %>% 
        distinct(line, station_name) %>% 
        count()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##       n
    ##   <int>
    ## 1    84

``` r
with_entry = filter(transit_df, vending == "NO", entry == TRUE) %>% 
        distinct(line, station_name) %>% 
        count()
        
total = filter(transit_df, vending == "NO") %>% 
        distinct(line, station_name) %>% 
        count()
```

There are 465 unique subway stations in NYC.

of those station, only 84 are ADA compliant.

43 out of 99 stations without vending allow entrance.

Let’s tidy up the data by creating a route\_name and route\_number
variable. Afterwards we’ll look at how many stations are on the A line
and how many of those are ADA compliant.

``` r
transit_tidy = 
        transit_df %>%
        mutate_at(vars(route1:route11), as.character) %>% 
        pivot_longer(route1:route11,
                     names_to = "route_number",
                     names_prefix = "route",
                     values_to = "route_name" ) %>% 
        drop_na(route_name) %>% 
        view


a_train = filter(transit_tidy, route_name == "A") %>% 
        distinct(line, station_name) %>% 
        view

a_count = count(a_train)

a_ada = filter(transit_tidy, route_name == "A", ada == TRUE) %>% 
        distinct(line, station_name) %>% 
        count()
```

There are 60 stations that service the A line. Of those 17 are ADA
compliant.

## Problem 3
